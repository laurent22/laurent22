I am an open-source developer working on projects related to Node.js, React Native and Electron, with funding and support from the community. I am also the main developer of [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org), the open source note-taking app. Your sponsorship, whether you are an individual, startup, or company, enables me to dedicate more time to open-source software!
